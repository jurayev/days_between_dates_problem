#Problem statement:

  Given your birthday and the current date, calculate your age in dates. Compensate for leap days. Assume that the birthday and the current date are correct dates (and no time travel). Simply put, if you were born 1 Jan 2012 and todays day is 2 Jan 2012 you are 1 day old.

Restrictions:
  No use of Date and DateTime and similar libraries.
